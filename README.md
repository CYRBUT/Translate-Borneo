## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project runs in an environment where Node.js is available to manage environment variables.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url/borneo.git
    cd borneo
    ```
2.  **Set up your Environment Variable:**
    The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. You must set this key as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

    How you set this variable depends on your hosting or development environment. For local development, you can use a `.env` file with a tool like `vite` or `dotenv`.

    - Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project.
    - Add your API key to it:
      ```
      API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
      ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    Serve the project files using a local development server. If you are using `vite`, for example:
    ```sh
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    Then, open your browser to the provided local address.
